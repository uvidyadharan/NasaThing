Put everything in "Scripts" in a folder together. Put the "navmeshsurface" script onto the moon object. 
Put "navigationbakernew" onto a object that is the parent of the moon object. Idk why it has to do this
Put the Agent Move script onto the cube or something that moves rlly quickly throughout the path.
